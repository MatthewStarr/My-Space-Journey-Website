        <br></br>
        <p>Earlier today I had my first meeting with the team of astronauts I will be accompanying around space.  As I have had no training in any field relevant for a space exploration they have given me the job role of entertainment officer.  So it is my job to make sure that everyone is entertained whilst on their breaks.  Meet the rest of the team:</p>
<p><h4><strong>Sven A. Bakor</strong> (Norwegian)- Pilot</h4>
Sven is the man in charge of piloting us around the galaxy.  Probably one of the most important jobs there is.  He said he was a pretty good at Asteroids as a kid so he’s been capable of doing the job from a young age.</p>

<p><h4><strong>Sonia Tamker</strong> (Swedish)- Co-pilot</h4>
Sonia is Sven’s right-hand gal as the ships co-pilot.  If Sven is flying through a particularly tricky asteroid field, somehow died or is just taking a nap then Sonia takes over as driver.</p>  

<p><h4><strong>Dr. Ezra U. Bomki</strong> (American)- Medical Expert</h4>
As you can probably gage from his title Dr. Bomki is the team’s lead medical expert.  If anyone gets some sort of space plague or scurvy he’ll be the guy to see.  The guy seemed pretty legit as he had a lab coat and a clipboard.</p>

<p><h4><strong>Jace Tona- Jenkins</strong> (American)- Nutritionist/ Nurse</h4>
To make sure we stay fit and healthy we have been given a nutritionist that will keep us eating healthy and exercising.  I’m not entirely sure what kind of exercise someone can do in zero gravity, but they deemed it important enough to have Jace on the payroll.  He also aids Dr. Bomki with fulfilling medical procedures.</p> 
 
<p><h4><strong>Zara M. Liska</strong> (German)- Engineer</h4>
As one of three engineers on the ship it is partly Zara’s responsibility to make sure that the ship is running and can be fixed if broken.</p> 
 
<p><h4><strong>Karim Rapel</strong> (Moroccan)- Engineer</h4>
Karim works along side Zara and Rory as an engineer.  He told me that as a child he would fix radios and believed fixing spaceships to be the obvious step for progression.</p>

<p><h4><strong>Rory T. Shafer</strong> (British)- Engineer</h4>
Our third engineer comes in the form of Rory.  After he graduated from Harvard he helped design the special toilets that are in the walls of the ship.  I think that’s the main reason he’s on the trip.</p>
 
<p><h4><strong>Margaret Temtchine- Corrie</strong> (French/ Scottish)- Lead Scientist</h4>
As we are going on a reconnaissance mission around space we have to have some top scientists on board to study any rocks we find or dissect any aliens we may encounter.</p>

<p><h4><strong>Jack S. Jameson</strong> (American)- Scientist</h4>
Jack is Margaret’s assistant and will follow her through the scientific journey they are bound to go on while studying all the weird stuff we find among the stars.  He’ll also have to keep track of the petri dishes.</p>

<p><h4><strong>Maidley Von Dux</strong> (Canadian/ German)- Psychiatrist</h4>
To stop us from catching the devastating Space Madness we have been issued a psychiatrist that we can talk to about the troubles we may face being stuck in a metal box floating around space; as well as any childhood issues we think  may be resurfacing.</p>

<p><h4><strong>Lalla Mulchond</strong> (Indian)- Psychiatrist</h4>
Maidley is the ship’s psychiatrist, but to make sure that he doesn’t develop Space Madness they issued Lalla to be the ship’s second psychiatrist.  Maidley will in return be Lalla’s psychiatrist and then there is little risk of anyone on board developing Space Madness.</p>
 
<p><h4><strong>Zena Torby</strong> (Russian)- Human Resources</h4>
Zena does the usual HR stuff.  Makes sure there is no sexual harassment in the workplace and that we’re not sitting too close to the computer screens.</p>
