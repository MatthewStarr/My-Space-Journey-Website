        <p>Sorry it’s been so long since the last post, i’ve been really busy.  I’ve got so much to tell you all.
<br></br>
Firstly, I recovered from the Moonbonic plague and was allowed out of isolation.  Secondly, we have been all over the place in the last few weeks.  We did a lot of the normal touristy things like played golf on the moon, roasted marshmallows by the Sun and went to see the Mars Rover.  Got some great views of saturn and it’s ring was pretty cool, if you’re into that sort of thing.  Karim thought he saw an alien on Mercury but it turned out to an odd shaped rock.  The gas planets were kind of dull and as you can imagine they smelt pretty bad.  Unfortunately we didn’t discover any aliens but Margaret and Jack have plenty of rocks to look at.  Another bit of good news is that none of us has died.
