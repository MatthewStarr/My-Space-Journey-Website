        <p>I was unaware that the space mission was supposed to be secret.  It is because of this that if you try and fact check anything that was mentioned on this blog you will not find any information.  I don’t know why you would want to fact check anything i’ve said as it is all 100% true.  The only reason this blog hasn’t been censored is because they never thought to check if the guy who won the cereal contest would write a blog about his space journey.  

So if anyone reading this could be so kind as to not mention anything you have read on this blog I would really appreciate it.  Even if you did talk about it everyone would think you were lying anyway.  I know i’m not lying because I experienced it and the reason there are no pictures is because we weren’t allowed to take cameras with us.  There are reasons why none of what has been said on this blog seems true because it has been shadowed in mystery, but you can trust me when I say it all definitely happened.
