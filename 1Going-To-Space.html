        <p>Hello,
<br></br>  
My name is Matt and I’m going to space!  I decided to start this blog so I could share my experience of preparing and then adventuring around space.  I will also write all the hilarious galactic scrapes I get into.
<br></br> 
Although I am both physically unfit and mentally unprepared I have been granted permission to join a crack team of engineers and scientists to travel around our universe.  I bet you are wondering how I got this gig.  A few weeks ago I was pouring myself a bowl of my favourite cereal, Saturn Rings, and was amazed to find a piece of card had fallen into my pile of sugary delights.  It read;
“Congratulations!  You are the lucky Saturn Rings eater who has won our grand prize. You have been invited to join a team of astronauts in their exploration amongst the stars, with no training involved!  Please send this card to the address that you can find on the back of the Saturn Rings box with your passport and we’ll be in contact.”  As you can imagine I was pretty excited and immediately put my passport in the post.
<br></br>
