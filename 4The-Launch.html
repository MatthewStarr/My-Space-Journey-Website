        <br></br>
        <p>As I’m writing this i’m in space!  We finally launched.  It was a day filled with nerves and excitement.  We said goodbye to our loved ones and climbed aboard.  There was a crowd of people watching from behind the wire fences surrounding the rocket.  I think I saw a journalist from the local paper.  It probably won’t be front page as this area is filled with news stories.
<br></br>
As the countdown started my heart began racing, sweat dripping off my forehead and my suit informed me the urine tank had reached capacity.  The engines were roaring and starting to heat up.  3, 2, 1.  The engines felt like they were going to explode as they blasted us off the ground and we shot into the sky.  Our world seems so small from up here.  
<br></br>
After about 2 days the seat belt sign turned off and we were all free to float around the cabin.  The ability to float is quite a unique one.  The beauty and grace you have whilst elegantly moving through the air, whilst the constant feeling like you’re going to be sick.
<br></br>
We made into space and now our travels can begin.
