        <p>As you can imagine they don’t just let anyone go into space.  Well normally they don’t.  Although I don’t have to do any sort of mental or physical training, I do have to familiarise myself with some of the equipment and try and stomach the weird space food.
<br></br>
Our space suits are pretty cool.  They’re made of super lightweight materials so we can move around in them and they’re not too heavy to wear.  One of my favourite functions of the suits are the fact that you can wee in them, but the excitement doesn’t stop there.  If someone is entering the ship after floating around outside they have to go through an antibacterial airlock room before coming inside.  It takes up to 3 hours in this room before they can re-enter and someone might become quite parched in this time.  This is where the suit comes into action.  You can urinate into the suit and it will distill the urine and make it drinkable for the occupier.  Now that’s got your appetites going let’s talk about the food.
<br></br>
The food is made up of things that have been dehydrated, turned into powder or have to be eaten like a heat up noodle dish.  Our dietary requirements have been heavily taken into account when it comes to what we given to eat.  There is food to give us iron, protein and all the stuff we need to stay alive.  Most of it tastes horrible and varies in consistency.  We do get to pick a few special food items to bring with us though as long as they are appropriate for space travel.  I have selected the dehydrated scrambled eggs, the peanut butter and jam sandwich powder and the steak you cook just by adding hot water.
